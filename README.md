## usage
Put the executable in the same folder your cave story is in.

if that folder doesn't have a "save" folder the program will create it for you.


"save as" will copy the last save you've made in cave story and store it in the "save" folder

"load" will replace the current save file with the selected one from the "save" folder.

"delete" surprisingly deletes the file from the "save" folder.
